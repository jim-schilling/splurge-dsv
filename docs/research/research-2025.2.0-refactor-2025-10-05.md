- **Exception Hierarchy:** Custom exceptions with detailed error information.
- **Static Methods:** Used in utility classes to avoid instantiation overhead.

## Module Analysis

### Core Modules

#### `text_file_helper.py`
**Purpose:** Public API facade for text file operations.  
**Design:** Static methods for line counting, previewing, reading, and streaming. Delegates to `SafeTextFileReader`.  
**Strengths:** Simple interface, memory-efficient operations.  
**Concerns:** Some parameter validation could be centralized.

#### `safe_text_file_reader.py`
**Purpose:** Deterministic text file reading with newline normalization.  
**Design:** Reads raw bytes, decodes, and normalizes CRLF/CR/LF to LF.  
**Strengths:** Robust cross-platform behavior, explicit error handling.  
**Concerns:** Binary read approach is correct but could be documented better.

#### `safe_text_file_writer.py`
**Purpose:** Deterministic text file writing with newline normalization.  
**Design:** Normalizes input newlines to LF before writing.  
**Strengths:** Consistent output format, type-safe with mypy.  
**Concerns:** Minimal API might need expansion for advanced use cases.

#### `exceptions.py`
**Purpose:** Custom exception hierarchy for error handling.  
**Design:** Base `SplurgeDsvError` with specialized subclasses. Includes deprecated aliases with warnings.  
**Strengths:** Detailed error messages, backward compatibility.  
**Concerns:** Large number of exception types (17 canonical + deprecated) may be excessive.

#### `path_validator.py`
**Purpose:** Security-focused file path validation.  
**Design:** Validates paths for traversal attacks, length limits, and character safety.  
**Strengths:** Comprehensive security checks, integration with file operations.  
**Concerns:** Complex validation logic could benefit from unit tests for edge cases.

#### `dsv_helper.py`
**Purpose:** Core DSV parsing and processing logic.  
**Design:** Handles delimiter detection, parsing, and data manipulation.  
**Strengths:** Flexible delimiter support, streaming capabilities.  
**Concerns:** Not analyzed in detail due to focus on text file utilities.

### Supporting Modules

#### `resource_manager.py` (Removed)
**Purpose:** Previously a deprecated compatibility layer.  
**Design:** Stub implementations that raised `NotImplementedError` or delegated to new APIs.  
**Status:** Removed to reduce maintenance burden and simplify the codebase.

#### `cli.py`
**Purpose:** Command-line interface.  
**Design:** Argument parsing and execution logic.  
**Strengths:** Standard CLI patterns, error handling.  
**Concerns:** Not analyzed in detail.

#### `__init__.py`
**Purpose:** Package initialization and exports.  
**Design:** Exports public APIs and handles edge cases like missing working directory.  
**Strengths:** Clean exports, resilient initialization.  
**Concerns:** Complex cwd handling may be unnecessary for most use cases.

## Design Analysis

### SOLID Principles

- **Single Responsibility:** Generally well-adhered. Each module has a clear purpose (e.g., `SafeTextFileReader` only handles reading and normalization).
- **Open/Closed:** Classes are extensible through inheritance (exceptions) and composition.
- **Liskov Substitution:** Exception hierarchy follows LSP.
- **Interface Segregation:** Small, focused interfaces (e.g., `SafeTextFileWriter` has minimal API).
- **Dependency Inversion:** High-level modules depend on abstractions (e.g., `TextFileHelper` delegates to readers).

### DRY Principle

- Well-adhered: Common patterns like path validation and error handling are centralized.
- Some duplication in exception definitions (canonical + deprecated).

### KISS Principle

- **Strengths:** Simple, focused APIs. Deterministic newline handling avoids configuration complexity.
- **Concerns:** Exception hierarchy is complex; deprecated code adds maintenance overhead.

## Architecture Analysis

### Layering

- **Presentation Layer:** CLI interface.
- **Application Layer:** Public APIs (`TextFileHelper`, `DsvHelper`).
- **Domain Layer:** Core logic (`SafeTextFileReader`, `SafeTextFileWriter`, `PathValidator`).
- **Infrastructure Layer:** File system operations, exception handling.

### Coupling and Cohesion

- **High Cohesion:** Modules have focused responsibilities.
- **Low Coupling:** Dependencies are minimal and well-defined.
- **Exception Handling:** Centralized in `exceptions.py`, used consistently across modules.

### Scalability

- **Performance:** Memory-efficient streaming operations, lazy evaluation where appropriate.
- **Extensibility:** Easy to add new file operations or exception types.
- **Maintainability:** Clear module boundaries make changes localized.

## Simplicity Analysis

### Code Complexity

- **Strengths:** Short, readable functions. Consistent naming and documentation.
- **Concerns:** Some modules have complex logic (e.g., path validation with multiple checks).

### API Design

- **Strengths:** Intuitive method names, sensible defaults, comprehensive docstrings.
- **Concerns:** Large number of parameters in some methods could be simplified with configuration objects.

### Configuration

- **Strengths:** Minimal configuration, sensible defaults.
- **Concerns:** Newline handling is hardcoded to LF, which is appropriate for the deterministic goal.

## Robustness Analysis

### Error Handling

- **Strengths:** Comprehensive exception hierarchy, detailed error messages, proper exception chaining.
- **Concerns:** Some deprecated exceptions may confuse users.

### Edge Cases

- **Strengths:** Handles mixed newlines, encoding errors, file permissions, path traversal attacks.
- **Concerns:** Coverage of edge cases could be improved (e.g., very large files, unusual encodings).

### Testing

- **Coverage:** 76% overall (good), with gaps in deprecated code and exception branches.
- **Quality:** 311 tests passing, mix of unit and integration tests.
- **Concerns:** Resource manager has 0% coverage (appropriate for deprecated code).

## Separation of Concerns Analysis

### Module Responsibilities

- **Excellent:** Each module has a single, clear responsibility.
- **File Operations:** Separated into reading and writing concerns.
- **Validation:** Path validation is isolated from file operations.
- **Error Handling:** Centralized exception definitions.

### Data Flow

- **Clean:** Data flows from validation → reading/writing → error handling.
- **Context Managers:** Properly separate resource acquisition from business logic.

## Maintainability Analysis

### Code Quality

- **Strengths:** Type hints, comprehensive docstrings, consistent formatting.
- **Concerns:** Some import ordering issues, complex exception file.

### Documentation

- **Strengths:** Detailed README, inline comments, docstrings.
- **Concerns:** API documentation could be more comprehensive.

### Testing

- **Strengths:** Good test organization, parallel execution, coverage reporting.
- **Concerns:** Some test files may need updates for deprecated APIs.

### Version Control

- **Strengths:** Semantic versioning, clear commit practices.
- **Concerns:** Deprecated code should be removed in major version bumps.
